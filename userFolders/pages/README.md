Pages go here. XREngine uses Nextjs under the hood, and your pages will be handled and routed as such. To add a route at mycoolmmo.io/example, make an example.tsx page and the routing will be handled for you.

For more information, check out https://nextjs.org

If you peek through your node_modules/xrengine/client/pages folder, all of the content from the feature demo app is available.
